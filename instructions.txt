- Each page should reach WCAG 2.0 Level AA.  Validate with http://achecker.ca/checker/ (Links to an external site.) and fix Known and Likely Problems. Do you best to fix issues that are labeled as Potential. Each Known error will be one point off.


- You should include one example of a transition and an animation somewhere in the site in a meaningful way. Transitions might work well in navigation, but look to use an animation in a featured area.

- One basic feedback form that:

    - Has the action="https://www.uu.edu/forms/WBFeedbackAction.cfm" (Links to an external site.) (this will be turned off after the class is over) and the method="post"
    - Passes two input type=”hidden” fields named:
        - Email with a value that is your e-mail
        - Website with a value that is your project name
    - Collects the required fields named:
        - UserName – input type=”text” limited to 50 characters
        - UserEmail– input type=”email” limited to 50 characters
        - UserComments – textarea limited to 200 characters
    - Include additional client-side validation that colors the fields when it is valid or invalid
    - Feel free to test this – it will e-mail the results to Email if successful

- AND one audio file that uses HTML’s <audio> tag.

- Use at least two different Bootstrap JavaScript components (modals, dropdowns, popovers, etc.) in the normal flow of your site.



Extra Credit:

- Include an example of parallax scrolling (involves background images shifting up or down as you scroll). This usually works best on your homepage. +5
