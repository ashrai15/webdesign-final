Write your site with HTML5 structuring tags (at least header, nav, section and footer) and validate with http://validator.w3.org/nu/ (Links to an external site.). Each error will be one point off.
Each page should reach WCAG 2.0 Level AA.  Validate with http://achecker.ca/checker/ (Links to an external site.) and fix Known and Likely Problems. Do you best to fix issues that are labeled as Potential. Each Known error will be one point off.
Add an external style sheet for print linked to each page of your site that should drop out the main navigation and any others items that aren’t the main content of the page (i.e. asides that are the same on every page). I want your pages optimized for printing. While Bootstrap may include some printing enhancements, I want this separate file included.
You should include one example of a transition and an animation somewhere in the site in a meaningful way. Transitions might work well in navigation, but look to use an animation in a featured area.
One basic feedback form that:
Has the action="https://www.uu.edu/forms/WBFeedbackAction.cfm" (Links to an external site.) (this will be turned off after the class is over) and the method="post"
Passes two input type=”hidden” fields named:
Email with a value that is your e-mail
Website with a value that is your project name
Collects the required fields named:
UserName – input type=”text” limited to 50 characters
UserEmail– input type=”email” limited to 50 characters
UserComments – textarea limited to 200 characters
Include additional client-side validation that colors the fields when it is valid or invalid
Feel free to test this – it will e-mail the results to Email if successful

Extra Credit:

Include an example of parallax scrolling (involves background images shifting up or down as you scroll). This usually works best on your homepage. +5
